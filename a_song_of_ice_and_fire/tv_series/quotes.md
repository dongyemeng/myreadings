Quotes of Game of Thrones TV Series

# Tyrion Lannister

*I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I'm guilty of being a dwarf.*


# Varys

# Who lives? Who dies?

*Varys: Three great men sit in a room. A king, a priest, and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives? Who dies?*

*Tyrion: Depends on the sellsword.*

*Varys: Does it? He has neither crown, nor gold, nor favor with the gods.*

*Tyrion: He has a sword. The power of life and death.*

*Varys: If itâ€™s swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsibly? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else?*

*Varys: Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow.*
