> Three great men sit in a room. A king, a priest, and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives? Who dies?
>
> Depends on the sellsword.

> Does it? He has neither crown, nor gold, nor favor with the gods.
>
> He has a sword. The power of life and death.
>

>
> I’ve decided I don’t like riddles.

> Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow.
